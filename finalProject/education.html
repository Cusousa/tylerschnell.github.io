<h3>Education:</h3>
<div class="w3 container">
<p> The first college I went to was Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina. I initially chose the major "Biological Scinces" but I changed my major during orientation to "Microbiology" because it was one less semester of Calculus.</p>
<p> The next place I went to college was a college called Tri-County Technical College.  I went here because after I got my bachelors from Clemson University, I was told that I would need to either get my Masters in Microbiology or get an associates degree in Medical Laboratory Technology in order to do anything with my Bachelors. So I decided to get my associates degree.</p>
<p> Now I am currently enrolled at IAcademy trying to get a bachelors of science in computer science with emphasis on software engineering.  The reason why is while I was working at TTI during the pandemic, all the engineers got to work from home but us technicians had to come in.  It made me think about my job security in the future and I wanted a job that, if I have to, I can work from home.</p>
