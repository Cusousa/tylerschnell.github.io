<h3>Early Life:</h3>
<div class="w3 container">
<p> I was born in a small city called Jackson, Tennessee in 1991 to my parents John and Dianne.  We lived in Tennessee with my brother Adam who was born in 1993 until I was 13 when we moved to South Carolina.  I enjoyed South Carolina more than Tennessee, the area of Tennessee we lived in was mostly cotton fields...so there wasn't much to do.</p>
<p> In South Carolina I went to a high school called TL Hanna High School.  Turns out, the school is famous because of a Hollywood movie called "Radio" starring Cuba Gooding Jr. was made about the school and the story of Radio, a football manager who had to overcome adversity and become accepted at the school.  It is a really good movie and recommend it to everyone.</p>
