<h3>Future Goals:</h3>
<div class="w3 container">
<p>For the future, I want to finish my education (third time's the charm hopefully).  My wife and I want to move back to the United States and work there.  Ideally I think we work there for 20ish years and then we want to move back to the Philippines for our retirement.  She has a long list of goals like owning a farm, starting a low cost vet hospital, traveling the world, and enjoying life here.</p>
