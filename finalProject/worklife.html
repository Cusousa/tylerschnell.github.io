<h3>Work:</h3>
<div class="w3 container">
<p> When I graduated from Clemson and entered the job market I started applying everywhere that I could.  I think I applied to upwards of 30 places and only heard back from 1 that I got rejected. So my dad got me on as a temporary worker at the place he worked at called TTI in the electrical engineering department.</p>
<p> Working at TTI was new, I essentially was working as a technican without any sort of knowledge in electrical components or how to solder, I was essentially a blank slate but I was willing to learn and I was a fast study.  I would joke with my coworkers that all the knowledge that I had before working at TTI about electricity was "black wire is negative, red wire is positive, and do not cut them at the same time. And the reason I know that is because my dad taught me the day before I started so that I wouldn't embarrass him." I don't think I would have embarrassed him but it makes for a good self deprecating humor joke.</p>
<p> I worked at TTI while I was in school at Tri County and once I graduated from Tri County, I left TTI to work at a hospital.</p>
<p> The hospital work was not a good fit for me.  For starters it was a long 45 minute commute each way.  Sometimes I would be on a surprise 12 hour shift...I say surprise because I would be scheduled for 8 hours and then they would tell me I would have to work 12 once I got there.  Some days I would be so busy I couldn't sit down, eat, or use the bathroom for 12 hours.  I would work swing shift, meaning I would work afternoons during the week and nights on the weekends.  Some days I would get 4 hours of sleep.  It was just not a good fit for me and so after 6 months I put in a 3 week notice to resign and I left the hospital work behind and haven't looked back since.</p>
<p> Since I left the hospital and was jobless, I had to find another job in order to earn money.  Luckily for me my old boss at TTI asked my dad how I was doing the day after I quit from the hospital and he told her how I had just quit from the hospital.  So she told him to tell me if I want to come back to TTI all that I have to do is come by today and talk to her about it and tell her what I want to do.  So when dad called me and told me that I ran out of the house, drove back to TTI and spoke with my boss and she offered me a job that very day to come back with a pay increase.  I guess you can say that I was forever grateful for my boss to let me come back and to give me a pay increase because I was just so miserable at the hospital.</p>
<p> I would work at TTI until I moved to the Philippines to be with my wife and to go to school at IAcademy.</p>
